## Laravel 4 OAuth2 Server

This library is basically a Laravel 4 wrapper for [bschaffer's oauth2-server-php](https://github.com/bshaffer/oauth2-server-php)

I wouldn't use this in a production environment as of yet, for a couple reasons being that this is still in development and it's practically inefficient at checking user passwords.
